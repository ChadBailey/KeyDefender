# KeyDefender
Block accidental keypresses that interrupt gaming

KeyDefender was originally created for my wife to prevent her from going into 
ALL CAPS RAGE when she accidentally hit the windows key taking her out of her 
game. Since then, it expanded to include more features as I've found the need. 
Now it has become a bit more of a "gaming buddy" than its original purpose. 
Here is a complete list of the current capabilities.

# Contributing

I would love to add features to this but this isn't exactly on the top of 
priorities. If you would like to contribute, please do! Here is a list of 
things I hope to one day implement

## Feature Backlog
 - Ability to save settings
 - Ability to configure hotkeys
 - More resolutions/configurable resolutions
 - Ability to allow caps lock to stay on, but not come out as caps when typing
     > You can see my progress on this by looking at any code that refers to 
     > "immunize" - I never got it working to my satisfaction
 - Ability to change power profiles, particularly if tied to the ability to 
   sense which (if any) external display is connected
 - A Linux/Mac version would be cool, but due to the nature of this being 
   strictly API based that would require every feature be completely rewritten
   for each supported platform.
